Figures/ - includes all figures I have created in R using the field data
Original-Data - Copy the original data collected for this experiment; another copy is also on my Google Drive
Cleaned-Data - includes all the cleaned data to be used for analysis; another copy is also on my Google Drive
Code - all the code used for my analyses of this data in R
clean_dfs.RData - data object that includes all the dataframes needed for analysis; always loaded in the beginning of my R scripts
Field2022.Rproj - The R project that uses all my R scripts in the Code folder

.gitignore is set to ignore all jpeg and docx files. It is also set to ignore the files Figures/ because that includes large files

***However, I can see that it is not reading my .gitignore and instead it is uploading all the files to my github anyway. How do I fix this??
